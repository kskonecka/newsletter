# newsletter
newsletter HTML example

It is an example of a newsletter written entirely in HTML.
As its to be viewed on all major inbox browsers, the newsletter is very simple, styled entirely in HTML tags and weights 38kb.

I strictly followed the latest recommendations for writing mailings and newsletter found on http://freshmail.pl/dla-developerow/raport-css/ 

It's written in Polish, based on the jpg file "mailing_pod_chmurami".
